This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS to process YouTube trending data. The pipeline ingests raw CSV and JSON data into Amazon S3, transforms the data into optimized Parquet format using AWS Lambda and AWS Glue, and enables analytical querying through Amazon Athena. The curated dataset is then visualized using Power BI by connecting directly to Athena.
